Football Analytics Project

Information about the Data:


The "Create Dataset" folder contains an rmd, "Final Make Data.rmd", which will construct the full dataset. It takes around 45 minutes to run. Also in the folder are all csvs it uses; if for some reason the links don't work to get the csv data, you can always download the csv onto your system and get the data that way.


The "Models" folder contains all of our classification and other models.


The "Propensity Scores" folder contains all of our propensity score work.


The other folders have old scripts that don't have much use anymore - their info has been transferred to the other main folders.
