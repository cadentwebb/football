Information about the Data:


The "Create Dataset" folder contains all csvs required, in addition to an rmd, that will create the final dataset that we used.
The "Final Make Data.rmd" will create that "FinalDataset.csv", which contains all the data we used in our modeling.
Your wd must be set to within that folder.


The "Models" folder contains all scripts and rmds that we used to create the various models discussed in our paper and presentation.
Once again, your wd must be set to within that folder. The csv with our data is "FinalDataset_ratings copy.csv"


The "Propensity Scores" folder contains the script for propensity scores.
Your wd must be set to within that folder. The csv with our data is "FinalDataset_ratings copy 2.csv".


The other folders were used in the process of making these main ones. They don't contain anything that the others don't.
